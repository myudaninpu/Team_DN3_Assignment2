---Model Overview
Model Used: ARIMA_PLUS trained on aggregated daily sales across 54 stores.
Features: Time series model incorporates:
Weekly and yearly seasonality
Step changes and spikes/dips in sales history
Drift in trend over time

---Model Evaluation
Log Likelihood: -20032.9
AIC: 40075.8
Variance: 1.49e+09
Interpretation: Model fit is reasonable based on log-likelihood and AIC, but high variance suggests a significant level of prediction uncertainty. Comparative benchmarking would improve confidence in accuracy.
---Patterns & Seasonality
Seasonality components are enabled (weekly and yearly).
Forecasts show daily fluctuations consistent with expected seasonal effects.
Visual inspection of forecasted values may better illustrate trends.
Spikes & Dips
The model confirms that the historical data contains spikes and dips.
These patterns are projected into the forecast, resulting in noticeable highs and lows across the 14-day prediction horizon.
Outlier days in the forecast should be flagged for deeper review.
---Key Insights
The forecast provides a useful directional signal and reflects known volatility and seasonal components.

However, high prediction variance means confidence should be tempered â€” especially for operational decisions.

--- Inventory Planning Guidance
Confidence Level: Moderate
Use this model for trend guidance, not deterministic forecasting.
Supplement with:
Safety stock buffers
Planned promotions/events
Domain knowledge from store operations and marketing
Consider running sensitivity analysis to assess impact under high-variance scenarios.
